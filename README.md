# Execute Terraform from Apache Airflow with simple DAG and BashOperator

For this experiment, I created a small EC2 on AWS. In this EC2, I installed [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), as well as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). 
My goal was to run terraform from airflow with python or bash.
After many failures i succeeded in running the terraform code that was a simple ec2 creation.

to write this readme I used the new [Wordtune](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wordtune-ai-powered-writi/nllcnknpjnininklegdoijpljgdjkijc?hl=en) Chrome extension, and am eager to try it again.
